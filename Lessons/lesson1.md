# Lesson 1 - Structure of a Web Application
### What is a web application? 
A web application or web app is a clientâ€“server computer program in which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser.

But what does that mean?

![Figure 1.1](/resources/WebAppStructure.png)

As shown in Figure 1.1, a web app is composed of two main parts: a __frontend__ and a __backend__.
The frontend is a set of computer programs that run on the user's computer (the __client__ computer), while the backend is a different set of computer programs that run on a more powerful __server__ computer.

So this definition is really just saying that a web application is a big set of computer programs, separated into a frontend and a backend, that is viewed in your web browser (and I extend this definition to include mobile apps).
