# Lesson 1 - Structure of a Web Application
### What is a web application? 
A web application or web app is a clientâ€“server computer program in which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser.

But what does that mean?

![Figure 1.1](/resources/WebAppStructure.png)

As shown in Figure 1.1, a web app is composed of two main parts: a __frontend__ and a __backend__.
The frontend is a set of computer programs that run on the user's computer (the __client__ computer), while the backend is a different set of computer programs that run on a more powerful __server__ computer.

So this definition is really just saying that a web application is a big set of computer programs, separated into a frontend and a backend, that is viewed in your web browser (and I extend this definition to include mobile apps).

### The Frontend
Simply put, the frontend is everything you *see* when you look at a website, or open a mobile app. 
For example, go to [Google.com](https://www.google.com). Take a look around. You might see some text, some images, and a big search box in the middle. All these components are drawn on your screen by the frontend code. 

#### Frontend languages
The Frontend can be either a website or a mobile app (or both), as shown in Figure 1.1.
The main three languages for building a website are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). HTML defines content, CSS defines how that content should look, and JavaScript adds interactivity to the page.

A mobile app frontend has more options. Here are some of them:
Swift, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, and, more recently, Dart.
