# Lesson 3 - HTML Review and Intro to CSS
## Introduction
Welcome back! 
Last week, you were introduced to your first coding language: HTML. 
You began learning using the KhanAcademy course, and hopefully you had fun making your very first webpages! Over the next week, you will begin learning your next language: CSS. This language, as we discussed in the last lesson, shows how the website will look when displayed in your browser.

## HTML Review
The exercises for this lesson are just a few things to remember from the Intro to HTML course. 
In the Intro to HTML course, you learned these tags:
- `<h1></h1>` The header tags
- `<p></p>` The paragraph tag
- `<br>` The break tag
- `<em></em>` The emphasis tag
- `<strong></strong>` The strong tag
- `<ul></ul>` The unordered list tag
- `<ol></ol>` The ordered list tag
- `<li></li>` The list item tag
- `<img>` The image tag

The exercises will ask you questions about the appropriate use of such tags.

## Starting CSS
