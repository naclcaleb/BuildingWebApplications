# Lesson 2 - Learn how to display web content with HTML
Now that you know how a web application is structured, it's time for you to start learning how to build one.

We'll start by learning how to build the frontend of the app, because there is much less concern when it comes to security and you'll get to see the results of your code appear in a fun, rewarding way. 

## Building the Frontend
Do you remember what the three main languages of the frontend are?

They are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

During this week, we will begin learning the first two of these: HTML and CSS.

### HTML
HTML is the language used to display things on a webpage, such as text, links, images, and other content.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
The web has a lot of hypertext. The HT  in HTML is the same HT you'll see in other places like the HTTP web protocol.

Hypertext is just text that is handled over (or "hyper") the internet.

A Markup Language is a special kind of coding language that, rather than giving commands to a computer, tells the computer *how* to display the content on a webpage, using special syntax that you will learn soon.

### CSS
CSS is the language we use to tell the browser how our HTML content should look. It stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This name doesn't make a lot of sense immediately, but let's try to understand.

The "Cascading" part of it means that our "stylesheets" have __hierarchy__. Some are more "important" than others.

"StyleSheets" are just what we call the code we write with CSS.

### Learning HTML
Now, I could try to teach you HTML, but there are already many great resources out there that can help you learn. We will be using the HTML/CSS and HTML/JS courses on KhanAcademy, which will teach you HTML with interactive lessons, and a live code editor to work with.

To start your first lesson, go [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/v/making-webpages-intro).

As you continue in the KhanAcademy course, you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS. The other lessons that I make will accompany those, and add new information that KhanAcademy leaves out.
